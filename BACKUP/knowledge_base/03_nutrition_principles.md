# Principle 3: Foundational Nutrition Habits

While total calories determine weight change, the composition and timing of those calories are crucial for optimizing body composition, performance, and overall health. The following habits provide a framework for building a sustainable, healthy eating pattern.

## Habit 1: Eat at Regular Intervals
Eating every 2-4 hours helps regulate blood sugar, manage hunger, prevent overeating at subsequent meals, and provides regular opportunities to stimulate muscle protein synthesis, which is key for retaining lean mass.

## Habit 2: Eat Protein-Dense Foods with Every Meal
Protein is the cornerstone of body composition.
- **LBM Retention:** A high protein intake is critical for preserving lean body mass (LBM) during a caloric deficit.
- **Satiety:** Protein is the most satiating macronutrient, helping you manage hunger.
- **Thermic Effect (TEF):** Protein has the highest TEF, meaning your body burns more calories digesting it.

**Target:** Aim for **1.8 - 3.1 g/kg of Lean Body Mass**. For a simpler approach, use the hand portion guide:
- **Men:** Aim for **2 palms** of protein-dense foods (e.g., chicken, beef, fish, eggs, tofu) with each meal.
- **Women:** Aim for **1 palm** of protein-dense foods with each meal.
(A palm-sized portion is the same thickness and diameter as your palm).

## Habit 3: Eat Vegetables with Every Meal
Vegetables are packed with vitamins, minerals, phytonutrients, and fiber. They also provide an alkaline load to the blood, which helps balance the acidic load from protein and grains, supporting bone and muscle health. They add volume to meals, increasing satiety with minimal calories.
- **Men:** Aim for **2 fists** of vegetables with each meal.
- **Women:** Aim for **1 fist** of vegetables with each meal.

## Habit 4: Time Carbohydrates Strategically
Carbohydrates are the primary fuel for high-intensity exercise and help with recovery. The amount you need depends on your activity level.
- **Focus:** Prioritize whole, minimally-processed carbohydrate sources like fruits, potatoes, and whole grains.
- **Fat Loss Timing:** For fat loss, it is most effective to consume the majority of your starchy carbohydrates (e.g., rice, bread, pasta, potatoes) in the meal **after your workout**. Fruits and vegetables can be eaten with any meal. This strategy helps ensure that carbohydrates are used to replenish muscle glycogen rather than being stored as fat.
- **Men:** Aim for **2 cupped handfuls** of carb-dense foods in your post-workout meal(s).
- **Women:** Aim for **1 cupped handful** of carb-dense foods in your post-workout meal(s).

## Habit 5: Eat Healthy Fats Daily
Dietary fat is essential for producing hormones, absorbing vitamins, and overall health.
- **Balance:** Aim for a mix of monounsaturated fats (avocados, olive oil, nuts), polyunsaturated fats (fish oil, flax, walnuts), and saturated fats (eggs, dairy, coconut oil). Fat intake should generally not fall below 20-25% of total calories.
- **Men:** Aim for **2 thumbs** of fat-dense foods with each meal.
- **Women:** Aim for **1 thumb** of fat-dense foods with each meal.

## Habit 6: Drink Zero-Calorie Beverages
Liquid calories from sodas, juices, and specialty coffees are a primary driver of weight gain because they provide energy without signaling satiety to the brain.
- **Prioritize:** Make water and unsweetened green tea your primary beverages.
- **Avoid:** Eliminate or strictly limit artificially sweetened beverages as well, as they can sometimes perpetuate cravings for sweet foods.

## Habit 7: Prioritize Whole Foods
The "healthiness" of a food generally declines in proportion to its degree of processing. Building your diet around whole foods ensures you get more fiber, micronutrients, and satiety from your meals.
- **Guideline:** Focus on foods that are as close to their natural state as possible.
- **Supplements:** Remember that supplements are meant to *supplement* a good diet, not replace it. Use them to fill specific gaps, but get the majority of your nutrition from whole foods.
