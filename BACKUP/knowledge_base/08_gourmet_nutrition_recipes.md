Breakfast
Spinach and Cheese Omelet (Anytime)
PRELUDE
This is a staple meal that is consistently found on our breakfast tables. There is something about the taste, texture, and nutritive properties of this omelet that really hits the spot first thing in the morning.
Fresh spinach works best for this recipe. Be sure to buy the pre-washed bags of fresh spinach, or be prepared to spend a lot of time over the sink washing each leaf. If you don't want to bother with fresh spinach, you can also use the frozen variety. Just thaw and drain it before cooking.
INGREDIENTS
6 large egg whites (1 cup) plus one whole omega-3 egg, beaten
4 oz. smoked turkey "ham", chopped
1 handful fresh spinach (or 1/3 cup frozen, thawed and drained)
1/2 cup mushrooms, sliced
1/3 onion, chopped
1 slice fat free cheese
INSTRUCTIONS
Stir-fry the chopped turkey, onions, and mushrooms in a skillet coated with olive oil cooking spray on medium-high heat for 5 minutes, or until things begin to brown. Add the spinach and stir for about 30 seconds, just until the spinach becomes dark green and condensed.
Given the size and mass of this omelet, special methods are necessary for ensuring a successful meal. Remove the contents from the skillet. Rinse the skillet to provide a fresh surface for the eggs, apply a new coat of olive oil cooking spray, and return it to medium-high heat. Add the beaten eggs. Wait a couple of minutes until you see bubbles starting to form around the edges of the eggs, then lift a portion of the eggs with a spatula, allowing the runny eggs on top to flow beneath the part that you lifted with the spatula. Do this in three or four places around the perimeter of the omelet. After another minute, when the bottom is solid again, flip the omelet.
After flipping the omelet, add the slice of cheese to the top, still exposed in the skillet, and then dump the sautéed mixture of turkey and vegetables onto one half of the omelet. Fold the omelet over to cover the contents, then slide it onto a plate and enjoy!

Then add the sautéed mixture of turkey and vegetables onto one half of the omelet and fold it over to serve.

Asian Scrambled Eggs (Anytime)
PRELUDE
This is a quick and easy recipe that provides a nice break from any breakfast menu that starts to become monotonous or stale. We are creatures of habit and once we find something we like, such as the spinach cheese omelet, then it's the same breakfast for a year. Well, variety is good. Who knows, after trying this one, it may even become your old standby.
Peanut oil gives this dish a nutty flavor that is a quality of any good Asian recipe. Together with the citrus zest of the ginger and the smoky soy sauce flavor, this dish is sure to please any aficionados of the Orient.

Stir-fry until the mushrooms start to brown and lose most of their moisture, and then add the chopped scallions. Stir-fry for another couple of minutes while drizzling half of the soy sauce over the mixture, and then remove the vegetables from the skillet. Add the remaining oil, then the eggs. When the eggs start to bubble around the edges, stir them with a spatula until scrambled. Just before the eggs are completely cooked, add the vegetables and mix thoroughly.

Flip the frittata to finish cooking, and then serve.
Shakshuka (PW)
PRELUDE
Shakshuka is a savory breakfast served in the Levant that incorporates eggs and tomatoes. Our version has the added goodness of steel-cut oats for a nutty flavor, a great texture, and all of the benefits of this nutritious grain.
INGREDIENTS
1/3 cup steel-cut oats
2 large tomatoes, chopped
2 tbsp tomato paste
1 medium onion, chopped
1 clove garlic, chopped
1 omega-3 egg
3/4 cup raw regular egg whites
Salt and pepper, to taste
INSTRUCTIONS
Bring the oats, tomatoes, and tomato paste to a boil in 2 cups of water. Cover and reduce heat to a simmer for 25 minutes.
Sauté the onion and garlic in a skillet coated with olive oil cooking spray and add these to the pot when the oats have finished cooking. The consistency should be thick, but a little soupy. More water may need to be added at this point to achieve the desired consistency.
Spread the whole egg and egg whites over the surface, stirring gently to break the yolk. Cover and simmer for an additional 3-4 minutes. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and serve it up.
Basic Oatmeal (PW)
PRELUDE
Don't feel like chopping vegetables & cracking eggs to make an omelet? Check out this tried and true breakfast. Go buy yourself a tub of plain, rolled oats, a.k.a. "old-fashioned oats," get some protein powder, and get started. But before doing so, we want you to do 2 things. First, make sure you get real oats. Avoid the sugary pitfalls of pre-packaged instant oatmeal. Also, make sure the protein powder you pick up actually tastes good. Many cheap protein powders taste worse than sewage so ask around for the good tasting varieties - and, importantly, try before you buy.
INGREDIENTS
1 cup rolled oats
1 cup skim milk
1 scoop vanilla whey protein powder or milk protein blend
1/2 cup berries (fresh or frozen, your choice of berries)
Splenda, to taste
Dash salt
Dash cinnamon
INSTRUCTIONS
Combine the oats, milk, salt, and cinnamon in a large bowl. Microwave for one minute, stir, then microwave for one additional minute. Stir in the berries, Splenda, salt, and cinnamon. Lastly, add the protein powder and mix completely. The oatmeal should have cooled slightly before the protein is added. Very hot oatmeal can damage protein powder, causing it to lump and sour.
Reese's Oatmeal (PW)
PRELUDE
Oatmeal - good. Chocolate peanut butter oatmeal - even better. This recipe exploits one of the best taste harmonies in existence to produce a meal that is quite simply addictive. Just don't go overboard on the peanut butter. Spend the time to measure your peanut butter with measuring spoons so that you don't grossly overestimate how much you're adding.
INGREDIENTS
1 cup rolled oats
1 cup Carb Countdown Dairy Beverage, Chocolate 2%
2 tsp natural peanut butter
Splenda, to taste
INSTRUCTIONS
Simple put all of the ingredients into a bowl and microwave for 1 minute, stir, then microwave for another minute, stir, and enjoy.
Muscle Gruel (PW)
PRELUDE
For all of you oat aficionados out there, this recipe is for you. It combines steel-cut oats, oat bran, and flax seeds into a hearty gruel that always satisfies.
INGREDIENTS
1/3 cup steel-cut oats
1/3 cup oat bran
1 tbsp whole flax seeds
1/2 cup blueberries (frozen or fresh)
1/2 tsp cinnamon
1/8 tsp salt
1 scoop vanilla whey protein or milk protein blend
Splenda, to taste
Water, see instructions for amount
INSTRUCTIONS
Many people avoid steel-cut oats because of the cooking time. Because steel-cut oats are broken parts of the whole grain, they require about 20 minutes of simmering. It can be well worth the wait, but we have devised a quicker method. So we'll give you two options for cooking:
Option 1 - Traditional Cooking Method
Combine the steel cut oats, salt, and 3 cups of water in a nonstick pot. Bring to a boil and simmer uncovered for 18 minutes on medium heat. Then add oat bran, flax seeds, and cinnamon. Stir thoroughly, remove from heat, add the berries, then the protein when sufficiently cool.
Option 2 - Quick Cooking Method
At night before going to bed, combine steel-cut oats, salt, and 2 1/4 cups water in a nonstick pan. Bring to a boil, remove from heat, and cover for the night. In the morning, bring to a boil again, add the oat bran, flax seeds, and cinnamon. Stir thoroughly, remove from heat, add the berries, then the protein when sufficiently cool.
Bran Porridge (PW)
PRELUDE
Here is a quick, easy meal that can be prepared in the office microwave. You'll get a lot of fiber in this one, so be prepared for a surprisingly filling bowl of porridge.
INGREDIENTS
1/2 cup oat bran
1/3 cup wheat bran
2 tbsp flax meal
1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce
1 scoop vanilla whey protein or milk protein blend
1/4 tsp cinnamon
1/8 tsp salt
Splenda, to taste
3/4 cup water (skim milk can also be used for a creamier texture)
INSTRUCTIONS
Combine oat bran, wheat bran, flax meal, cinnamon, salt, and water in a large bowl. Microwave on high for 30 seconds, stir, then microwave for an additional 30 seconds, or until hot but not boiling. Remove from microwave and stir in applesauce, Splenda, then protein powder. If you don't like the taste of your protein powder it can be left out if the porridge is eaten with a protein-rich meal (like eggs).
Oatmeal Apple Pie (PW)
PRELUDE
Blending Americana with nutritional know-how, this recipe makes a great breakfast for anyone looking for a morning dose of complex carbs, soluble fiber, and high-quality protein.
INGREDIENTS
3 cups rolled oats
1 cup oat bran
2 large apples, cored and chopped
2 cups unsweetened applesauce
4 scoops vanilla protein powder or milk protein blend
1 tsp salt
2 tsp cinnamon
4 cups water
1 tsp vanilla extract
Splenda, to taste
Skim milk (1 cup per serving)
INSTRUCTIONS
In a large bowl combine oats, oat bran, protein powder, salt, vanilla extract and water. In a separate bowl, mix the apples, applesauce, cinnamon, and Splenda. There are two ways to proceed. You can either combine the applesauce mixture and oat mixture together and bake, or for a layered effect, you can pour the applesauce mixture into the baking dish first, then pour the oat mixture on top. In both cases, bake in an 8x8-inch dish coated with olive oil cooking spray for 35 minutes at 350 degrees F.
Serve in a bowl with 1 cup skim milk poured over top.
Muesli (PW)
PRELUDE
Even with all of the choices we have lined-up for breakfast, sometimes it's nice to have a bowl of cold cereal. Here is a way to feed that urge without wasting away into the prototypical skinny-fat cereal junkie.
INGREDIENTS
2 cups rolled oats
4 tbsp whole flax seeds
1/4 cup wheat bran
1/2 cup oat bran
1/4 cup sliced almonds
1/2 cup sugar free maple syrup
1/2 tsp coconut extract
Splenda, to taste
INSTRUCTIONS
Combine all of the ingredients in a large mixing bowl and mix thoroughly. Coat a baking dish with olive oil cooking spray, and spread the muesli out in the dish. Don't pack tightly, but rather allow clumps to remain. Bake at 350-degrees F for 30 minutes. Allow to cool, then serve with Carb Countdown lowfat milk beverage.
Protein Pancakes (PW)
PRELUDE
Even pancakes can still be a part of a healthy breakfast menu with our version of whole wheat, protein-packed mancakes (or womancakes - wouldn't want to leave anyone out).
Make your own topping with fruit and/or berries. Strawberries or blackberries with or without a little Splenda are always a good choice. Wild blueberries can also be added to the batter before cooking.
You could also use cottage cheese and berries for added protein. If the curds of cottage cheese turn you off, put the berries, cottage cheese, and Splenda in a blender for about 30 seconds for a thick, creamy topping.
INGREDIENTS
1 cup whole wheat pancake mix (any variety will do, as long as it's whole wheat)
2 heaping scoops of vanilla whey protein powder
3/4 cup lowfat cottage cheese
3 egg whites (1/2 cup)
3 tbsp flax seeds
1/4 cup water
INSTRUCTIONS
Place the egg whites, cottage cheese, flax seeds and water in a blender and process until smooth. Mix the wet ingredients together with the pancake mix and protein powder in a large bowl.
Cook the pancakes any size you like them in a skillet coated with olive oil cooking spray over medium-low heat. After pouring the pancake batter into the skillet, they will be ready to flip after bubbles form around the edges (about 5 minutes).

Kung Pao Chicken (Anytime)
PRELUDE
Here is a healthy version of one of the most popular Chinese dishes in existence. The medley of chicken, golden peanuts, and bright red chiles is not only incredibly tasty, but also a pleasure to look at. The reason why this dish has finely chopped chicken, unlike the thinly sliced meats of most Asian cuisine, is because the emperor who it is named after- Gong Bao - had bad teeth. This tradition has survived today in this delightful rendition of an imperial bureaucrat's favorite grub.
INGREDIENTS
Marinade:
1 lb raw chicken breast, chopped into 1/2- inch cubes
4 cloves garlic, chopped

Fajita Chicken and Rice (PW)
PRELUDE
You can throw this one together very quickly from pre-cooked chicken and rice for a healthy, delicious meal. Fajitas have a healthy base (chicken and vegetables), but they are often drenched in unhealthy oils while cooking. Also, they are served with enticing, warm fajitas made from white enriched flour, which are almost always a source of overindulgence. Our recipe skips the tortillas and uses the grilled chicken and vegetables as a topping over a bed of spiced brown rice.
INGREDIENTS
1 lb roasted chicken breast, cut into fajita strips
Steamed brown rice, from 1 cup dry
1 small onion, sliced

Roasted Chicken with Rosemary Wheat Berries (PW)
PRELUDE
Wheat is one of the most widely available & commonly used grains across the world but most people have never even seen whole wheat. Before it reaches our tables, it's usually processed to the extreme. This recipe, however, includes real wheat - commonly called wheat berries. Wheat berries also have more vitamins, fiber, and micronutrients than other types of wheat. In this dish, the flavor of wheat berries is complemented with fresh rosemary. Together with carrots and broccoli, a flavorful bed is made for a roasted chicken breast.
INGREDIENTS
1 lb roasted chicken breast
1 cup wheat berries
4 cups water
2 cup broccoli flowerets
2 cups (ca. 16) baby carrots
2 tbsp fresh rosemary leaves
1/2 tsp garlic powder
Salt & pepper, to taste

In a pot with a tight-fitting lid, bring the water and a dash of salt to a boil. Add wheat berries, cover and simmer for 45 minutes. Add broccoli, carrots, rosemary, garlic powder, salt and pepper, stir, and simmer for an additional 15 minutes with the lid on. After this final simmering time, remove the lid and boil off any additional liquid. Top with roasted chicken breast to serve. This dish can also be cooked in bulk, refrigerated, and then reheated together with the chicken breast for a quick meal.

Place the coconut-topped chicken on a baking sheet coated with olive oil cooking spray, and bake at 400 degrees for 20 minutes, broiling for the last 10 minutes.
While the chicken is roasting, steam the broccoli in a large covered pot with 1 inch of boiling water in the bottom. Steam the broccoli in this manner for 8-10 minutes, then separate onto two plates, drizzling with olive oil, lemon juice, salt and pepper. Serve with the roasted chicken breasts.
Apple Chicken Casserole (Anytime)
PRELUDE
Casseroles often seem like a lot of work because of the baking time involved, but as long as you plan ahead, they are actually quite easy.

INSTRUCTIONS
In a skillet coated with olive oil cooking spray, sauté the chicken, garlic, and onions for about 5 minutes, until the outside of the chicken is cooked, while remaining raw in the center. Combine everything in a large bowl, and then transfer to a 9x9 inch baking dish coated with olive oil cooking spray. Bake at 375-degrees F for 40 minutes.
Turkey Sausage Casserole (Anytime)
PRELUDE
Here is a dish that will change your impression of a casserole from wimpy to rugged.

Bake uncovered at 400 degrees F in preheated oven until firm, about 35 to 40 minutes. Let cool to room temperature before serving.
Apple Mushroom Turkey Burgers (Anytime)
PRELUDE
Ground turkey breast is a great addition to any menu, but it is not the most palatable of ground meats. Many people new to ground turkey are disappointed when they try to use it just like ground beef. Simply forming ground turkey into a patty and grilling it makes a rubbery, tasteless burger. Fortunately, we've found a way to make a juicy turkey burger with an incredible taste, all served in a nice little protein-filled package. This dish can be complemented with a nice big pile of steamed spinach, or it can also be served with a large dose of carbohydrates if you want a good post-exercise meal.
INGREDIENTS
1 lb ground turkey breast
5 mushrooms, finely chopped
1/2 small onion, finely chopped
1/2 apple, finely chopped
1/2 tbsp butter, coconut oil, or Smart Balance spread
1 tsp lemon juice
1 omega-3 egg
1/2 tsp salt
Garlic powder and pepper, to taste
INSTRUCTIONS
Fry onions until brown (5-10 minutes). Add apples and mushrooms and stir-fry for an additional 4 minutes. Place all of the ingredients into a large bowl and mix thoroughly. Form into 2 large patties and broil 4 inches from heat, 6 minutes on each side. The burgers are done with juices run clear after being pierced with a fork.
Turkey Meatballs (PW)
PRELUDE
Here is another great way to enjoy ground turkey. These meatballs are very quick and easy, and they provide a considerable amount of fiber and omega-3 fatty acids from milled flax seeds.
INGREDIENTS
1 lb. ground turkey breast
1/2 cup ground flax seeds
1/4 cup wheat bran
1/2 small onion, chopped fine
4 cloves garlic, chopped
1 omega-3 egg plus 2 regular egg whites, beaten
Salt and pepper, to taste
INSTRUCTIONS
Mix everything together in a large bowl, then separate into 2-inch meatballs and placed on a cookie sheet coated with olive oil cooking spray. Bake at 375-degrees F for 30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean.
Baked Yam with Turkey Meatball Marinara (PW)
PRELUDE
Yams are a great source of carbohydrates for the post exercise hours. Thankfully, they can be quickly nuked and stuffed with pre-made ingredients. This is a gourmet meal that can be quickly prepared at school or the workplace, after your grueling morning workout.
INGREDIENTS
1 lb. ground turkey breast (97-98% lean)
3 medium tomatoes
2 medium yellow or white onions
8 cloves garlic
1 large green pepper
1 omega-3 egg, beaten
1 medium yam
Dried oregano and basil, dash of each
Salt & pepper, to taste
INSTRUCTIONS
To make the marinara sauce, chop the tomatoes and place them in a nonstick pan over medium-low heat. Mix in 4 cloves chopped garlic & 1 chopped onion, and sliced green pepper. Stew with a lid after stirring in a dash of salt, some oregano & basil.
To make the meatballs, mix these together in a large bowl: ground turkey, 4 chopped garlic cloves, 1 chopped onion, beaten egg, and a dash of salt and pepper. Form into 2-inch meatballs and place on a cookie sheet, and bake for 15-20 minutes at 400 degrees F. They're done when you can poke them with a toothpick and the juice that comes out is clear, rather than cloudy.
The meatballs and marinara can be mixed together and refrigerated in a covered container until you're ready for the meal.
To bake the yam, poke some holes in it with a fork or knife and nuke for about 6 minutes, until a fork can be easily inserted into the center. Cut the baked yam down the center and mash the interior with a fork. Stuff it with the meatballs and marinara. Heat everything in the microwave until warm.
Falafel Platter (PW)
PRELUDE
Falafel is the hamburger of the Levant. Like our burgers, most falafel stands have turned something healthy into a handheld heart attack. Granted, falafel sandwiches typically have a lot more veggies and fiber than a burger. But the deep fried part of falafel is the real gut-buster. Our version avoids the deep fryer, and brings the goodness of chickpeas to your plate, while staying true to the spirit of Levantine flavor. Oh yeah, we added a whole heap-o protein.
INGREDIENTS
1.5 servings of falafel mix (about 0.65 cups dry)
8 oz grilled chicken breast
1/2 serving hummus (see recipe in "Side Dishes" section)
1 medium cucumber, chopped
1 tomato, chopped
2 tbsp lemon juice
Salt & pepper, to taste
INSTRUCTIONS
Soak the falafel mix in water as directed, and form a few 1" balls from the dough. Fry in a non-stick pan coated with olive oil cooking spray. Flatten the falafel balls a little in the pan and flip them repeatedly. It also helps to lower the heat and put a lid on the pan to cook them thoroughly.
Cut the chicken in cubes, adding some salt and pepper when grilling or reheating.
Chop the cucumber and tomato in small pieces and mix together with the lemon juice, salt, and pepper.
Serve in separate portions on a large plate
Seafood
Seared Sea Scallops in a Spinach Cream Sauce (PW)
PRELUDE
This protein-rich meal can be used to appease any significant other who often grumbles about your eating habits. It's simple, delicious, full of micronutrients, and suitable for a candlelit dinner.
INGREDIENTS
1 lb raw sea scallops
2 pkgs frozen spinach (20 oz. total)
1 pkg (6 oz) sliced mushrooms
2 large carrots, sliced
4 tbsp diced shallots (or substitute with 8 chopped green onions)
8 tbsp plain yogurt (whole)
2 tbsp lemon juice
3 cloves diced garlic
1-inch cube ginger root, diced
Pinch of saffron (or a small dash of turmeric)
Salt and pepper, to taste
INSTRUCTIONS
Defrost the spinach in the microwave in a large bowl. Sauté mushrooms, garlic, shallots, and ginger in a skillet with olive oil cooking spray for about 2 minutes. Add scallops and continue cooking 2 to 3 minutes just until flesh is opaque. Add the spinach and bring mixture to a boil. Stir in yogurt 1 tbsp at a time. Add carrots, salt, pepper, dill weed, lemon juice, saffron, and simmer for 15-20 minutes, uncovered, stirring frequently. Some of the liquid should boil off, but if the mixture starts becoming dry, cover the skillet with a lid for the remainder of the cooking time.
Pecan-Crusted Salmon (Anytime)
PRELUDE
Pecan meal and olive oil create an aromatic crust for a salmon fillet, and serve to complement the long chain fatty-acids in the fish with a healthy dose of monounsaturated fat. This meal provides an excellent way to finish your day with protein and very healthy fats. Steamed spinach completes this meal and provides a plethora of vitamins and micronutrients from one of the healthiest vegetable choices available.
INGREDIENTS
10 oz salmon fillet (8 oz cooked)
2 tbsp pecan meal
2 big handfuls raw spinach (about 20 mature leafs)
1 tsp olive oil
1 tsp butter, coconut oil, or Smart Balance spread
Salt & pepper, to taste
INSTRUCTIONS
To make the pecan meal, process whole pecans or pieces in a blender on low 1 cup at a time. The pecan meal should be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator.
Mix 2 tbsp pecan meal and 1 tsp olive oil in a small bowl, then coat the top of the salmon fillet. Add salt and fresh ground pepper. You can either de-skin the salmon before cooking, or place the salmon skin-side down on a cooking tray covered with aluminum foil. After cooking, the skin will stick to the foil and you can peel the fillet right off.
Cook the salmon in an oven at 400-degrees F for 12 minutes, broiling for the last 6 minutes.
While the salmon is cooking, steam the spinach in a pot with a tight-fitting lid in 1-inch of boiling water.
Sesame-Crusted Salmon with Sautéed Peppers (Anytime)
PRELUDE
Sesame seeds form a magnificent crust for a salmon fillet, adding both texture and a nutty flavor accentuated with peanut oil. Sesame seeds are small enough to stick to the salmon without using flour, and form a crisp golden coating together with chopped ginger when the salmon is pan fried. Bell peppers and onions provide a nice side dish for the salmon, after releasing their juices in a small amount of olive oil.
INGREDIENTS
Salmon Ingredients:
1 lb salmon fillets, de-skinned
1/4 cup sesame seeds
1 tbsp peanut oil
1 inch square fresh ginger, chopped
1/8 tsp cayenne pepper
Sautéed Pepper Ingredients:
1 small onion, sliced
2 cloves garlic, sliced thin
2 bell peppers, sliced into 1/4-inch strips
1/4 cup fresh chopped basil
1 tbsp olive oil
INSTRUCTIONS
Season the salmon fillets on both sides with the salt and cayenne. Spread the sesame seeds onto a dinner plate, and then press the fillets into the sesame seeds, turning them once. Coat the salmon fillets completely, and gently shake off the excess seeds.
Heat the peanut oil in a large skillet over medium high heat, and stir-fry the ginger for a couple of minutes until slightly browned. Sear the fillets in the pan until the crust is golden, about 2.5 minutes on each side.
To make the sautéed peppers, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat, add onions and garlic, stirring frequently for about 5 minutes, until onions start to brown. Add the peppers and salt, and stir-fry for an additional minute or two. Cover, reduce the heat to medium-low, and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the peppers start to soften. Remove the lid and stir in the basil and pepper. Serve on the side with the sesame crusted salmon.
Salmon in a Basil Cream Sauce (Anytime)
PRELUDE
There are undoubtedly certain sauces that make an incredible entrée when served with a food such as salmon (which is even delicious alone). A variety of cream sauces can be found in salmon dishes across the globe, but most of these use heavy cream. Our recipe uses the much healthier source of yogurt for a cream sauce that combines various ingredients together into a full flavored harmony that will send your taste buds reeling.
INGREDIENTS
1 lb salmon fillets, cut into 2 pieces and de-skinned
3/4 cup fresh chopped basil
1/8 cup fresh chopped parsley
2-3 shallots, chopped
1/2 cup whole plain yogurt
1/3 cup white cooking wine
Juice from 1 large fresh lemon
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tbsp olive oil
1/8 tsp salt
INSTRUCTIONS
Sear the salmon in a skillet on medium-high heat for 3 minutes on each side. The middle of the fillets may not be entirely cooked after this period, which is fine because the salmon will continue to cook after it is removed from the skillet.
Sauté the shallots and garlic in the same skillet on low-medium heat for about 5 minutes, until they are golden brown. Increase the heat to medium-high, and then add the wine, basil, parsley, lemon juice, and salt, bringing to a boil. Stir the yogurt into the mixture slowly, 1 or 2 tablespoons at a time. Reduce the sauce to about half of its original state, then add the salmon fillets to reheat. Serve with the sauce spooned over the salmon.
Rosemary Salmon and Asparagus on the Grill (Anytime)
PRELUDE
The next time you set out to barbecue, don’t overlook seafood in lieu of more traditional beef or chicken. Salmon is great on the grill, given its meatier composition, compared to most fish. This recipe combines the powerful fragrance and flavor of rosemary with the great properties of salmon. Asparagus completes this dish, which is surprisingly easy to make.
INGREDIENTS
1 lb salmon fillets cut into 2 pieces
20 large asparagus, trimmed
2 tbsp fresh rosemary leaves
1 tbsp olive oil
3 cloves garlic, chopped
2 tbsp fresh lemon juice
Salt and fresh ground pepper, to taste
INSTRUCTIONS
Leaving the skin on the salmon, place skin side down on a piece of dry aluminum foil. Be sure the aluminum foil is cut large enough to wrap entirely around the salmon fillets.
Coat the fillets with lemon juice, olive oil, garlic, rosemary, salt & pepper, in that order. Enclose the salmon in the foil, leaving a small breathing hole at the top about 1-inch in diameter. Place this package on an outside grill on medium-high heat. Close the grill and cook for 10-15 minutes. Depending on how close you live to a coast and the freshness of the fish, you can choose whether you want to go for the best taste, which involves leaving the center slightly pink, or whether you choose the safest route of longer cooking for a white, flaky flesh through and through.
The asparagus should be grilled separately, beginning about 5 minutes into the cooking of the fish. Coat the asparagus with olive oil, then place on the grill lengthwise so they don’t slip through the grate. Every other minute or so, roll the asparagus so that one side does not burn. It does not take long for this to happen, so stay with the asparagus. When the asparagus is toasted brown, lightly salt and remove from the heat.
When the fish is finished cooking, you can remove it easily from the skin, which will stick to the foil. Just slip a spatula between the flesh and skin and slide them apart.
Striped Bass with Artichokes and Asparagus (Anytime)
PRELUDE
To make an incredibly tender and moist bass fillet, it can be slow roasted at low heat in the oven. White wine, garlic, and black olives complement striped bass without overshadowing it. It is served on a bed of sautéed artichokes and asparagus.
INGREDIENTS
Fish Roasting Ingredients:
1.5 lb striped bass fillets, with skin
2 cloves garlic, sliced thin
4 tbsp sliced olives (preferably Greek)
1.5 tbsp dry white wine
1 tsp olive oil
Salt and pepper, to taste
Vegetable Bed Ingredients:
1 lemon, halved
1 14-ounce can (or 1 box frozen) artichoke hearts, drained
1 lb asparagus, trimmed and cut into 2-inch lengths
1/3 cup fresh parsley
1 tbsp olive oil
Salt & pepper, to taste
INSTRUCTIONS
Lightly brush 1 tsp olive oil onto the bottom of a glass baking dish just big enough to accommodate the fish fillets. Scatter the sliced garlic into the baking dish, and then arrange the fillets skin side down. Top the fillets with sliced olives; drizzle with white wine. Sprinkle with salt and freshly ground pepper.
Bake the fish at 225-degrees F for 15 to 20 minutes, until the flesh separates easily from the skin and a kitchen fork slides with no resistance into the thickest part of the fillet.
Prepare the vegetable bed while the bass is cooking. Combine the olive oil and garlic in a large skillet over medium-high heat. After soaking the canned artichoke hearts for a while in cold water to remove the brine taste (this is unnecessary if they are frozen), drain them and add them to the skillet. Stir-fry for about 4 minutes until chokes start to brown, and then add asparagus and 1/4 cup water. Cover, and cook for 2-4 minutes, tossing the vegetables occasionally. Remove the lid and allow the remaining water to steam away, and then add the fresh parsley, salt, and pepper. Separate onto two plates, squeeze the fresh lemon juice over the top, and serve as a bed for the striped bass fillets.
Almond-Crusted Sea Scallops with Tomato-Onion Gratin (Anytime)
PRELUDE
Sea scallops provide a large dose of protein with very little fat. For this meal, we have used almonds and olive oil to supplement healthy monounsaturated fatty acids. This dish is a real crowd-pleaser, and suitable for a candlelit dinner with a fine wine.
INGREDIENTS
Almond-Crusted Sea Scallops Ingredients:
1.5 lb sea scallops, rinsed and patted dry
1/2 cup almonds, ground into meal in a blender
1/2 tsp salt
1/4 tsp cayenne pepper
1 tbsp olive oil
Tomato-Onion Gratin Ingredients:
1 medium onion (preferably Vidalia), sliced
2 medium tomatoes, cut into 1/4-inch thick wedges
1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese
2 garlic cloves, chopped
2 tsp olive oil
1/4 cup fresh cilantro, coarsely chopped
Salt & pepper, to taste
INSTRUCTIONS
In a large bowl, toss the onions, tomatoes, olive oil, garlic, and salt & pepper. Spread out evenly in an 8x8-inch baking dish coated with olive oil cooking spray. Bake for 25 minutes at 450-degrees F.
While the tomato-onion gratin is baking, process the almonds in a blender until ground into a course meal, and then spread onto a dinner plate. Sprinkle the scallops with salt and cayenne, and then press them into the almond meal. Roll the scallops around until almond meal adheres to all sides, and then shake off the excess.
Heat some of the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat, and add only enough scallops to coat the bottom of the pan in a single layer. Sear the scallops about 2 minutes on each side until they are browned and crisp. Transfer the browned scallops to a plate and sear the remaining scallops in the same manner, adding oil as needed.
Arrange the scallops on top of the tomato-onion gratin and garnish with cilantro.
Tuna Burgers (Anytime)
PRELUDE
Canned tuna no longer needs to be eaten out of the can most unceremoniously. You can turn those plain old cans of tuna into a delicious meal by adding just a few ingredients. Flax meal and omega-3 eggs form a nice matrix for these burgers, and add precious omega-3 fatty acids, bound within a flavorful zest from the remaining ingredients. This dish can be served with grilled peppers and tomatoes or a toasted quinoa salad (both recipes are presented in our side dishes section).
INGREDIENTS
3 cans chunk light tuna in water, drained (14 oz drained)
1/4 cup flax meal
4 scallions (green onions), minced
2 tbsp black mustard seeds
2 omega-3 eggs, beaten
1 tablespoon finely minced fresh cilantro
2 cloves garlic, chopped
1 tsp soy sauce
Salt & pepper, to taste
2 tsp olive oil
INSTRUCTIONS
Combine all of the ingredients except the olive oil in a large bowl. Form into two large patties. Pan fry the tuna burgers in a skillet with the olive oil over medium heat, for about 6 minutes on each side, until both sides are browned and the burgers cooked throughout.
Salmon Burger Stroganoff (Anytime)
PRELUDE
Canned salmon is a good option for the frugal among us, but it takes some creativity and preparation to make it palatable. Unless you’re training for a slot on Fear Factor, you probably don’t like the idea of eating the slimy, bony pieces that come straight from the can. Most salmon burger recipes commonly available produce a dry, tasteless meal. So we’ve tweaked some ingredients to make it taste better with the healthiest ingredients, and added a mushroom sauce to make this a mouth watering delicacy.
INGREDIENTS
Salmon Burgers:
1 large can (14.75 oz.) salmon
1/4 cup flax meal
1/4 cup oat bran
1 omega-3 egg, beaten
1/2 small onion, diced
1 tbsp lemon juice
1/8 tsp turmeric
Salt & pepper, to taste
Stroganoff Sauce:
2 cups sliced mushrooms
3 cloves garlic
5 tbsp plain whole yogurt
1 chicken bouillon cube
1/4 cup water
INSTRUCTIONS
Drain the salmon, except for 1 tbsp of the juice, and put into a large bowl. Remove the larger bones (vertebrae). Add the flax meal, oat bran, diced onion, egg, turmeric, salt, and pepper, and mix together thoroughly. Shape and flatten into 2 large patties. Cook the patties in a skillet sprayed with olive oil cooking spray on medium heat for 8-10 minutes on each side.
To make the stroganoff sauce, brown the garlic and mushrooms in 1 tbsp butter or SmartBalance spread for 6-8 minutes, then add the water and bouillon cube, bringing to a light boil. Stir in the yogurt one tablespoon at a time, until achieving a smooth, creamy texture.
Top the salmon burgers with the stroganoff sauce just before serving.
Beef & Lamb
Seared Ground Beef with Zucchini and Tomatoes (Anytime)
PRELUDE
Zucchini and tomatoes are both sweet vegetables that when cooked together really sing, particularly in the presence of ground beef seared in a pan. This is a quick way to make use of a pound of lean ground beef and the vegetables laying around in your fridge’s crisper.
INGREDIENTS
1 lb 96% lean ground beef
1 large zucchini, sliced
1 large tomato, chopped
1/2 medium onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, chopped
2 tbsp fresh chopped basil
1 tbsp olive oil
Salt & pepper, to taste
INSTRUCTIONS
Add a little of the olive oil cooking spray to a nonstick pan over medium-high heat, and then brown the ground beef for about 3 minutes. Add the zucchini, garlic, and onions and stir-fry for another 8-10 minutes, until vegetables are browned. Add tomato and cook until chunks begin to dissolve, about 3-4 minutes. Stir in the basil, olive oil, and spices and serve.
Thai Ground Beef (Anytime)
PRELUDE
As long as you are using extra lean ground beef (96% lean), the addition of a peanut sauce and chili powder provides a powerful taste combination that compliments the bold flavor of beef. Cabbage adds a nice textural component, and the green peppers complete the meal.
INGREDIENTS
1 lb extra lean (96%) ground beef
1/3 head cabbage, shredded (about 3 cups)
1 carrot, sliced
1 medium green pepper, cut into 1-inch cubes
1 small onion, cut into 1-inch cubes
2 tbsp peanut sauce
Salt, pepper, and chili powder, to taste
INSTRUCTIONS
Fry the ground beef in a large nonstick skillet coated with olive oil cooking spray over medium-high heat for about 5 minutes, until browned. Add the cabbage, carrot, green pepper, and onion and continue cooking for another 5 minutes, stirring frequently. After the vegetables have browned, add the peanut sauce and spices. Serve warm.
Sautéed Beef in an Indian Spinach Sauce (Anytime)
PRELUDE
The Indians have mastered the art of combining flavorful spices in colorful, creamy sauces made from a variety of cheese and yogurt. Yogurt is a healthful addition to this dish, providing a creamy base for spinach and spices. When served with sautéed beef, this mouthwatering dish is two steps away from Nirvana.
INGREDIENTS
1 lb sirloin, cut into 1-inch cubes
10 oz spinach, fresh or frozen
1 large onion, quartered
2 1-inch cubes of fresh ginger, peeled
6 cloves garlic
1 cup frozen green peas
1 cup whole plain yogurt
1 tbsp olive oil
1/4 cup water
1 tsp curry powder
1 tsp garam masala spice powder
Salt & pepper, to taste
INSTRUCTIONS
Put the onion, ginger, and garlic in a food processor and make a puree or paste. This can also be done in small batches in a blender. Brown this puree in a large skillet on medium-high heat together with the olive oil, about 10 minutes, or until the mixture gets brown and loses some of its moisture. Remove from the skillet, and then add the beef and sauté for a few minutes until brown. Return the onion, garlic, and ginger mixture back to the skillet, add the water, stir, and then begin adding the yogurt 1 tbsp at a time, stirring constantly. Add the curry powder, salt and pepper.
When the creamy mixture has begun a light boil, begin adding the spinach. Fresh is best, but if you choose frozen, thaw it and drain any liquid before adding. Cover and simmer for about 5 minutes, reducing the spinach. Remove cover and add garam masala just before serving.
Beef Stroganoff (Anytime)
PRELUDE
Mushrooms naturally compliment beef, and when a cream sauce is added, the two flavors resonate with a hearty goodness. Typical stroganoff dishes use heavy cream and cheese, dropping a heavy dose of saturated fat and extra calories on unsuspecting masses. Our version uses yogurt for the cream, and just a hint of cheese to complete the taste.
INGREDIENTS
1 lb beef sirloin, cut into 1-inch cubes
1 large onion, chopped
3 cups sliced mushrooms
1 carrot, sliced
4 cloves garlic, chopped
1/2 cup beef broth, from bouillon
1 cup whole plain yogurt
1/2 cup shredded part skim mozzarella cheese
Salt & pepper, to taste
INSTRUCTIONS
Brown the beef in a large nonstick skillet coated with olive oil cooking spray over medium-high heat, about 5 minutes. Add the onion, mushrooms, carrot, and garlic, and continue stir-frying for an additional 6-8 minutes, until vegetables start to brown. Add the beef broth, salt, and pepper, bring to a low boil, and then add the yogurt 1 tbsp at a time, stirring constantly. Cover and simmer for 15 minutes on medium-low heat. Remove the lid, add the cheese, and stir until thoroughly blended.
Peppered Sirloin with Grilled Onions and Balsamic Syrup (Anytime)
PRELUDE
By coating a steak with spices and pan-searing it, a delicious and satisfying crust is created that provides both flavor and texture. The ginger imparts a slightly floral essence and flavor that is nicely balanced with fresh ground pepper. This flavor combination goes wonderfully with grilled onions and the sweet, tangy flavor of balsamic syrup. To round-off this meal, serve with Mashed Garlic Cauliflower (this recipe is presented in our side dishes section).
INGREDIENTS
1.25lb sirloin steak
1 large onion, sliced
1 cup balsamic vinegar
1 tsp finely grated fresh ginger
1 tsp olive oil
1 tsp butter, coconut oil, or Smart Balance butter spread
Salt & pepper, to taste
INSTRUCTIONS
To make the balsamic syrup, add one cup of balsamic vinegar to a saucepan, and bring to a boil over medium heat. Boil the vinegar until it has reduced to one quarter of the amount you started with (reduce to 1/4 cup). It will turn into thick, bubbly syrup. Be sure not to overcook, as it can burn easily near the end. If the reduced vinegar becomes too thick when it cools, heat it slowly with 1/2 to 1 tablespoon of water until it is a desirable consistency.
In a large skillet, melt the butter/spread over medium-high heat and add the onions. Sprinkle with salt and toss to coat, and then stir fry for 8-10 minutes, until the onions are nice and browned. The longer the onions are browned, the sweeter they become (without burning of course).
Pat the steaks dry with paper towels, and then rub them lightly with the oil. Massage the salt, ginger, and a generous amount of freshly ground black pepper over the steaks.
Sear the steaks in a heavy nonstick skillet over high heat about 4 minutes on each side for medium-rare, or 5-6 minutes for medium-well. You will know it’s time to turn the steaks when little droplets of blood form on the surface.
Nestle a mound of onions next to the steaks, and then drizzle the balsamic vinegar syrup over everything.
Greek Burger (Anytime)
PRELUDE
Sometimes you discover a mixture of ingredients that puts a smile of content on your face at your first bite. Elegant and simple, the mixture of feta, olives, and garlic in this recipe, within confines of extra lean ground beef, makes a burger unparalleled in flavor. If that regular old burger is getting stale and uninviting, then kick it up a notch with this Greek influenced hamburger steak.
INGREDIENTS
1 lb extra lean (96%) ground beef
1/2 cup feta cheese, crumbled
1/2 cup olive slivers
3 cloves garlic, chopped
Salt & pepper, to taste
INSTRUCTIONS
In a large bowl, combine all of the ingredients. Form two large patties with the mixture, and then cook them on a grill or in a large skillet on medium heat for 5-8 minutes on each side. Some good options for side dishes include the Mediterranean salad, grilled peppers and tomatoes, or mashed garlic cauliflower (all presented in our side dishes section of the book).
Broccoli Beef Stir Fry (Anytime)
PRELUDE
When beef and broccoli are combined in a stir fry with plenty of garlic, it provides a tasteful and satisfying dish with copious lean protein and monounsaturated fat from the nutty-flavored peanut oil. There are no bells and whistles in this recipe. It was streamlined for a quick, easy, nutritious meal.
INGREDIENTS
1 lb London broil, thinly sliced
2 cups broccoli flower clusters
1 large carrot, sliced
1 large onion, coarsely chopped (1-inch squares)
4 cloves garlic, chopped
1 tbsp peanut oil
1 tbsp soy sauce
1/4 tsp salt
INSTRUCTIONS
London broil can be very tough, so if you plan ahead, it’s best to marinade the beef after slicing it. A good marinade for this dish is chopped garlic, a dash of soy sauce, salt, and a little oil. Even an hour of marinating makes a big difference. Stick the meat in the fridge to marinade. Overnight would be even better. If you want to skip the marinade, no worries; just be prepared to work those jaw muscles.
When you’re ready to cook, sauté the garlic in the oil for a few seconds in a large skillet or wok, and then add the sliced beef. Stir-fry for a few minutes until the beef is nearly cooked throughout. Add the broccoli, carrot, onion, and salt, and continue stir frying for an additional 5-6 minutes. Drizzle the soy sauce over the top before serving.
Roast Beef Hash (Anytime)
PRELUDE
Traditional roast beef hash combines the fattiest cuts of meat with potatoes for an undesirable combination of saturated fats and high GI carbs. Our version provides a healthy alternative with the same satisfying combination of beef, root vegetables, onions, and herbs that has made hash such a deliciously comforting dish.
INGREDIENTS
1 lb leftover beef roast, bottom round, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
1 cup coarsely chopped onions or leeks (white part only)
2 turnips, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch cubes (about 3 cups)
1 tbsp plus 1 tsp olive oil
3 cloves garlic, chopped
2 tsp minced fresh thyme or rosemary
1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped
3/4 cup water
Salt & pepper, to taste
INSTRUCTIONS
In a large skillet/wok, heat 1 tbsp olive oil over medium-high heat; sauté the onions until they are tender and golden brown, about 8 minutes. Add the turnips, toss, and then add the water and salt. Cover the pan and cook until the water has evaporated and the vegetables are just tender, about 10 minutes. Uncover and stir-fry the vegetables until well caramelized and browned, about 5 minutes.
While the vegetables are browning, heat 1 tsp olive oil in another skillet, sauté the garlic and minced herbs for a couple of minutes, and then add the diced roast, tossing the pieces just until browned and heated through.
Toss everything together and serve hot.

PRELUDE

Before serving, stir in the olive oil, and then garnish the meals with fresh parsley in wide, shallow bowls.
Sautéed Herb Beef with Turnips (Anytime)
PRELUDE
The turnips in this recipe are a nice substitution for potatoes in a low carb meal, for those “meat and potato” people. The remaining vegetables and herbs provide a nice balance of tastes and textures, as well as plenty of antioxidants and micronutrients.
INGREDIENTS

Stir the turnips into the skillet, and then add the broth.
Spread evenly onto two plates, drizzle a teaspoon of extra virgin olive oil over each, and voila, you’re done.
Meatloaf (PW)
PRELUDE
Great meals shouldn’t be this easy to make. This recipe provides another method for discretely including cottage cheese on the menu without anyone other than the chef knowing that it’s present. This meatloaf has the added benefit of low-GI complex carbs and fiber from the oat bran, and omega-3’s from flax seeds.

1 cup lowfat cottage cheese
1/2 cup oat bran
1 beaten omega-3 egg (e.g., Pilgrim’s Pride Eggs Plus or Eggland’s Best)

Chicago Deep Dish Pizza (PW)
PRELUDE
Here is another recipe to satisfy that instinctual desire for pizza. Our own version of deep dish pizza avoids the obscene amount of carbs and fat, instead offering a protein-rich alternative with plenty of micronutrients, vitamins and antioxidants from the vegetables.
INGREDIENTS
Crust:
1/2 cup whole wheat flour
1 cup wheat bran
1/4 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp salt
1/2 cup water
Pie:
1/2 lb 96% lean ground beef
1 small onion
2 cloves garlic
1 cup chopped mushrooms
1 large tomato
1/2 large green pepper
1/2 cup shredded mozzarella
Basil and oregano, to taste
INSTRUCTIONS

In a large skillet, stir fry the ground beef and garlic for 3 minutes, until beef starts to brown. Add onion, mushrooms, tomato, and green pepper and stir fry for an additional 3 minutes. Transfer the meat and vegetables to the baking dish/pan, spreading evenly over the crust. Cover with the shredded mozzarella, and bake at 400-degrees F for 12 minutes, broiling for the last 4 minutes.
Lamb Kebabs (Anytime)
PRELUDE
This dish was inspired by the masters of the kebab – the Turks. A proper Turkish kebab uses ground lamb, and is a true culinary experience. Any preconception of tough, greasy circus fare will quickly dissolve when you sink your teeth into this version of grilled meat with just the right mix of vegetables and spices. Generally, a true flame grill (charcoal or propane) makes a better tasting kabob, but a regular old oven broiler works fine in a pinch. Suitable side dishes to serve with this meal include the Grilled Peppers and Tomatoes and/or Tabouli. You’ll have such an authentic and delicious Turkish meal that it may inspire spontaneous Dervish whirling. Just be sure to allow proper digestion first.
INGREDIENTS
1 lb ground lamb
1/4 cup fresh parsley
1/4 cup fresh mint leaves
1/2 small onion
1 large egg, beaten
1 large bell pepper, seeded and cut into 1-inch squares
8 cherry tomatoes
1/2 tbsp olive oil
1/4 tsp ground cinnamon
1/4 tsp ground black pepper
1/2 tsp salt
INSTRUCTIONS
Finely chop the fresh parsley, mint leaves, and onion. This can be done with a knife or a food processor. In a large bowl, combine the ground lamb, beaten egg, parsley, mint, onion, and spices. Mix well, and then form into 8 oval balls.
Preheat the oven broiler, or the charcoal grill. If you’re using wooden skewers, soak them in water for 30 minutes to prevent them from burning. Using the bell peppers as braces on each end of the kabobs, prepare the skewers, leaving a little space at the end of each for the tomatoes.
For the first half of the cooking period, leave the tomatoes out of the equation. Coat the kabobs with olive oil and cook about 4 inches from the heat for 5 minutes. Remove the skewers, put the cherry tomatoes on the ends, then return to the oven or grill on the other side for another 5 minutes, or just until the meat is cooked through.
Soups & Stews
Dr. John’s Chili (PW)
PRELUDE
Chili is one of the best ways to get a massive helping of protein from ground beef, together with a healthy dose of fiber from beans, our wonderful legume friends. Add a bunch of spices and vegetables, and you’ve got yourself a nutritive meal that can be made in bulk and stored for the week.
Many of the best chili recipes use corn meal to thicken-up the dish. This is great for the taste buds and texture, but we’d rather not have the added carbs from corn. Instead, we use cashew meal, which serves to thicken the chili, as well as add a unique taste; not to mention a healthy dose of monounsaturated fatty acids.
This pot of stew could feed a village in Ethiopia for a week, so be prepared to store about 4 day’s worth.
INGREDIENTS
4 lbs extra lean ground beef (96%)
4 cans kidney beans (15.5 oz per can), drained and rinsed
2 large onions, chopped
2 large tomatoes, chopped
1 lb carrots, peeled and sliced
4 bell peppers – 1 green, 1 red, 1 yellow, 1 orange, cut into 1/2-inch squares
6 cloves garlic, chopped
Two 46-fl oz bottles V8 vegetable juice, spicy hot
Cashew meal
Spices: 4 tbsp chili powder, 1 tsp cumin, 2 tsp paprika, 1 tsp celery seed, 1 tsp fresh ground pepper (for a quicker version, you can use 3 packages chili seasonings mix, but it won’t quite be the same!)
INSTRUCTIONS
In a large skillet, brown the ground beef, one pound at a time, over high heat together with the garlic and onions. If your skillet is large enough (i.e., a wok), you can brown the beef all at once to save time. On the last batch, add the spices after the beef is browned and continue frying for another couple of minutes. Add the browned beef to a very large pot with a lid, and then add the beans, tomatoes, carrots, peppers, and V8 juice. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat to simmer.
To make the cashew meal, process the cashews in a blender in short bursts, until a grainy meal is formed. Do not process for too long or you will have cashew butter. Stir in the cashew meal, cover, and simmer for an additional 30 minutes.
London Broil Stew (PW)
PRELUDE
Have you ever been enticed by the cheap prices and lean cut of a London broil (top round), only to find that you need the chewing power of a mountain gorilla to eat it? The key to making London broil and other tough meats palatable, for those of us without a saggital crest, is low temperatures and long cooking times. Crock Pot? Check. Tender meat? Check. Barley was added to this recipe because it complements the taste of beef. It is also very nutritious: whole barley has more fiber per gram than oat bran, and it is rich in Vitamin A, folate, calcium and magnesium. The remaining vegetables provide a nice harmony to the final product, which is one of the most filling and satisfying 500 calories that you’ll come across.
INGREDIENTS
2 lbs London broil, cut into 1” cubes (fat removed)
1/3 cup whole uncooked barley
1 large onion, cut into 1” squares
1 large tomato, chopped
4 large stalks celery, chopped
4 large carrots, chopped (or a large handful of whole baby carrots)
4 tbsp whole flax seeds (or 8 tbsp ground)
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 bay leaf
1 beef bouillon cube
2 tbsp olive oil
Salt & pepper, to taste
3 cups water
INSTRUCTIONS
Preheat the Crock Pot to 300-degrees F (medium).
In a large skillet or wok, brown the cubed steak and minced garlic in half of the olive oil, just until the outside is brown (leaving the inside raw). When the beef is browned, add the water and bouillon cube to the skillet. Bring to a boil, then pour mixture into the Crock Pot
With the remaining oil, stir-fry the onion, celery, and carrots in the skillet on medium-high heat for 5 minutes, then transfer to the Crock Pot.
Add the remaining ingredients to the Crock Pot, cover and simmer at 300-degrees F (medium or low) overnight
