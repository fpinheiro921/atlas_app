# Principle 6: Train for Muscle Retention and Adjust Cardio Strategically

Exercise is a critical component of successful, long-term weight management.

## Resistance Training: The Non-Negotiable

The primary goal of resistance training during a fat loss phase is to **preserve muscle mass**. The stimulus that builds muscle is the same stimulus that maintains it.
- **Progressive Overload:** This is the key principle. You must consistently challenge your muscles to give them a reason to stick around. This doesn't just mean adding more weight. It can be:
    - Adding reps at the same weight.
    - Adding sets.
    - Improving form or control.
- **Intensity is Key (RIR):** Train with sufficient intensity. Most working sets should be performed with a **Reps in Reserve (RIR) of 1-3**. This means stopping 1-3 reps shy of absolute muscular failure, which is intense enough to stimulate muscle without causing excessive fatigue that hinders recovery.
- **Consistency > Everything:** Your training plan should not change dramatically just because you are dieting. The goal is to maintain (or even improve) performance as much as possible.

## Metabolic Conditioning (MetCon)

For users focusing on bodyweight training or those who want to maximize cardiovascular benefits, MetCon is an excellent tool.
- **Focus:** MetCon workouts prioritize work capacity, cardiovascular endurance, and mental toughness over maximal strength.
- **Structure:** These workouts are typically performed "for time" (completing a set amount of work as fast as possible) or as AMRAPs ("as many rounds/reps as possible" in a given time).
- **Benefit:** This style of training is highly efficient at improving overall fitness and can be a sustainable way to increase energy expenditure.

## Cardio: A Strategic Tool, Not a Punishment

Cardio is a tool to help create a caloric deficit. It is not the primary driver of fat loss and should not be used to "punish" yourself for eating.
- **Start Low, Go Slow:** Begin your fat loss phase with the minimum amount of cardio necessary. This gives you a tool to use later when you hit a plateau.
- **Making Adjustments:** When a plateau occurs, you have two options: decrease calories or increase activity. A small increase in weekly cardio (e.g., adding one 15-20 minute session) can be enough to break a stall without having to drop food intake further.
- **Tapering Cardio During a Reverse Diet:** Just as you slowly add calories, you should slowly **reduce** your cardio. This contributes to re-establishing a sustainable energy balance at a higher caloric intake.
    - **Conservative Reverse:** Reduce weekly cardio by 2.5-7.5%.
    - **Moderate Reverse:** Reduce weekly cardio by 7.5-15%.
    - **Aggressive Reverse:** Reduce weekly cardio by 15-25%.
    - **Rule of Thumb:** Pair smaller calorie increases with larger cardio reductions, and vice-versa.
