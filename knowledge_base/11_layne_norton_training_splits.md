# Principle 8: Sample Training Splits

These sample splits are based on the principles from "The Complete Reverse Dieting Guide" and should be used as a template for generating training plans. The focus should be on compound movements and progressive overload within the specified RIR ranges.

## Beginner (2-3 days/week)

Focus on mastering form on compound lifts and consistent progression. Full body routines are highly effective.

**Sample 1: Full Body (2x/week)**
- **Workout A:** Squat variation, Bench Press variation, Row variation, Face Pulls.
- **Workout B:** Deadlift variation, Overhead Press variation, Lat Pulldown/Pull-up variation, Leg Press.

## Intermediate (3-5 days/week)

Increased volume and frequency to continue driving progress.

**Sample 1: Upper / Lower Split (4x/week)**
- **Day 1:** Upper Body (Strength Focus: 5-8 reps)
- **Day 2:** Lower Body (Strength Focus: 5-8 reps)
- **Day 3:** Rest
- **Day 4:** Upper Body (Hypertrophy Focus: 10-15 reps)
- **Day 5:** Lower Body (Hypertrophy Focus: 10-15 reps)
- **Day 6 & 7:** Rest

**Sample 2: Push / Pull / Legs (3-6x/week)**
- **Day 1:** Push (Chest, Shoulders, Triceps)
- **Day 2:** Pull (Back, Biceps)
- **Day 3:** Legs (Quads, Hamstrings, Glutes, Calves)
- *Can be run once (3 days) or twice (6 days) per week.*

## Advanced (5-6 days/week)

High frequency and volume splits for experienced lifters.

**Sample 1: Full Body (5x/week)**
- Each day focuses on one primary compound lift (Squat, Bench, Deadlift, Overhead Press, Row) followed by accessory work for other body parts. This allows for high frequency on each muscle group.

**Sample 2: Body Part Split**
- **Day 1:** Chest
- **Day 2:** Back
- **Day 3:** Shoulders
- **Day 4:** Legs
- **Day 5:** Arms
- **Day 6 & 7:** Rest
