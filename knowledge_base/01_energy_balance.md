# Principle 1: Energy Balance is the Primary Driver of Weight Change

The foundation of all weight management is the principle of Energy Balance, often referred to as Calories In vs. Calories Out (CICO).

- **Caloric Deficit:** To lose weight, you must consume fewer calories than your body expends.
- **Caloric Surplus:** To gain weight, you must consume more calories than your body expends.
- **Maintenance:** To maintain weight, calories consumed must equal calories expended.

While the *types* of food you eat can influence the "calories out" side of the equation and affect satiety, the overall energy balance dictates whether weight is lost or gained.

## Components of Energy Expenditure (TDEE)

Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) is the total number of calories you burn in a day. It's composed of four key elements:

1.  **Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR):** The energy required to keep your body functioning at rest (e.g., breathing, circulation). This accounts for approximately 60% of your TDEE and is the largest component. It is primarily influenced by lean body mass.

2.  **Thermic Effect of Food (TEF):** The energy used to digest, absorb, and metabolize food. Protein has the highest TEF (~20-30%), followed by carbohydrates (~5-10%) and fats (~0-3%). This accounts for about 10-15% of TDEE.

3.  **Exercise Activity (EA):** The calories burned during purposeful exercise, like resistance training or cardio.

4.  **Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis (NEAT):** The energy expended for everything we do that is not sleeping, eating, or sports-like exercise. This includes walking, fidgeting, maintaining posture, and other daily movements. NEAT is the most variable and adaptive component of TDEE.
